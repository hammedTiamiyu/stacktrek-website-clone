# Winery Clone Application

Welcome to the Winery Clone Application! This project is a ReactJS application built with Vite, designed to mimic the functionality and design of a winery website. If you're looking to create a beautiful and user-friendly winery website, you're in the right place.

## Features

- **Homepage**: Your number one spot to get the list of your favourite github users
- **Follower**: A redirection to github user's profile


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following tools installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) if you prefer)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/hammedTiamiyu/stacktrek-website-clone.git

   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

### Usage

1. Start the development server:
